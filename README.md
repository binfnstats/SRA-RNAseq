**SRA-RNAseq**
‚úíÔ∏è Our Guthub repo include pipelines for running Pre-processing methods such as Trimming, quality control and pseudoalignment using [Trimmomatic](https://github.com/usadellab/Trimmomatic), [fastQC](https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC) and [Kallisto](https://github.com/pachterlab/kallisto) tools respectively.
All the pipelines are written 
using the [Workflow Description Language (WDL)](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl) and can be executed using 
[Cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
